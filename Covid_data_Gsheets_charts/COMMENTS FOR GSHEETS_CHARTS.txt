-Graphical environment is a big plus
-some simple calculations can be really time consuming, repettive and annoying
 in GSheets
- would personally not prefer this tool, it feels kinda incompelte to be honest.

needed to add new data columns for finland, was not a big deal, just added them 
and zeroed them

- no boxplot avail.
- onlye candlestick charts are available, which look similar, but don't contain exactly
the same information, talk about high, low, open, close etc.
