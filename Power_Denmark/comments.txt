3.1
a) We did a line plot for the Onshore wind power generated, for both price areas for the whole time series.
without processing the data.
We thought the result was very interesting because even though we wanted to do a line plot, due to the fact 
that the variations on the power generated and the huge amount of data we have it makes the line plot 
look like a lot more an area chart. It might be hard to interpete this line plot at the beginning but with some careful
observation it makes us understand the vast variations between the power generated.

b) averaged the the onshore wind power produced and created a much prettier histogram.
